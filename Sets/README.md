# Sets

So far, you've learned about sequential data structures such as arrays(lists), stacks, queues, and linked list. We will cover a data structure known as sets, which is also a sequential data structure that does not allow duplicated values.

You'll learn how to create a set data structure, add and remove values, and also to search whether a value already exists. You will learn also some mathematical operations such as union,intersection, and difference.

A **set** is a collection of items that are unordered and consists of unique elements(they are no duplicate values). The list of objects within the set is surrounded by `{}` (curly braces).

A set with no element is called  a **null set** or an **empty set**. You can also imagine a set as an array with no repeated elements and no concept or order.

In mathematics, a set has some basic operations such as union, intersection, and difference.
