# Algorithm Complexity

We are going to talk about the **big-O notation** and the NP-Completeness theory.

## Big-O notation

The big-O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. When analyzing algorithms, the following classes of functions are the most commonly encountered:

| **Notation**   | **Name**         |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| *O(1)*         | Constant         |
| *O(log (n))*   | Logarithmic      |
| *O((log(n))c)* | Poly-logarithmic |
| *O(n)*         | Linear           |
| *O(n2)*        | Quadratic        |
| *O(nc)*        | Polynomial       |
| *O(cn)*        | Exponential      |
