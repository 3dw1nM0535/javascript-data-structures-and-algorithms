# Queues

Queues are very similar, but instead of LIFO, they use a very different principle known as **FIFO(First In First Out)**.

A queue is an ordered collection of items. Queues work with the principle of *first-come first-served*

The addition of new elements in a queue is at the tail, and the removal is from the front. The newest element added to the queue must wait at the end of the queue.

The most common popular example of a queue in real life is the typical line we form from time to time. We have lines for movies, the cafeteria, and a checkout line at a grocery store among other examples. The first person in the line is the first person to be attended to.
