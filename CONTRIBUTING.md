## Here are some ways that you can help

We encourage anyone and everyone especially those getting started to learn to code to find ways they can contribute and file their first PR. For example,

1. You know of some data structure or algorithm that has not been covered in the repo and you want it to feature here.
2. You want to write or add more test cases for some data structure or algorithm covered in this repo and you want it to be implemented.
3. You know of some way you can contribute to help this project be of help to the community and you feel like this can be of much help to me(I'm also learning to code remember), you, and the community.

## Contributing

Issues can be submitted by anyone - seasoned developers or newbies.

### Getting Started

1. If you are new to [GitHub](https//:github.com), I suggest you go through [GitHub For Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/) before moving on to step **2**.
2. Think of adding or improving something? [Guide on contributing to a project on github](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).



**I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?**

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without first creating an issue. Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code or structural aspect.
